              <Header>Scholarships for Roosevelt Graduates</Header>
              The Roosevelt Alumni Foundation has contributed over $70,000 in scholarships to both hard-working and need-based students (not necessarily determined by federal guidelines).

              The purpose of this program is to provide financial aid to graduates of Roosevelt High School who demonstrate the ability, desire and have a financial need to be met in order to pursue academic, trade or vocational school goals.
